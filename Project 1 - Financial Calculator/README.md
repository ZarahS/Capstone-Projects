## 1. Types of Interest

Interest is a fee for borrowing money. It is usually a percentage of the amount borrowed or saved. When you borrow money, the lender will charge you interest. When you save money, the bank will pay you interest. There are 2 types of interest, simple and compound.

### Simple Interest

Simple interest is a type of interest where the interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount, without taking into account the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that the interest does not earn interest and the interest amount remains the same for the life of the loan or savings account.

### Compound Interest

Compound interest is where the interest is calculated on the initial principal amount, but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that the interest earns interest, leading to a faster growth of the investment or debt. The interest is usually compounded on a regular basis, such as annually or monthly.

## 2. Equations

This calculator utilises a bond repayment and a simple and compound interest formula to generate an output for the user.

| Equation Type        | Equation          | Description  |
|:-------------:|-------------|-----|
|Bond Repayment |  $$\ \frac{i\times P}{1 - (1 + i) \^{-n}} $$  | *i* = the monthly interest rate, *P* = present value of the house and *n* = the number of months over which the bond will be paid. |
| Simple Interest| $$\ P(1 + r \times t) $$ |*P* = the amount the user deposits, *r* = interest perecentage divided by 100 and *t* = number of years the money is being invested.|
| Compound Interest| $$\ P(1 + r)^{t} $$    |As above|
